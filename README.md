I created this repo with the purpose of learning crypto / blockchain by trying to (terribly) implement the concept I learnt from various papers:
* Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper
* Hashcash (cost-function)
* How to time-stamp (1991 paper)
* ...

The best way to learn something is just to do it knowing that you would fail.
